    "In this set of exercises we will perform simulations of room-temperature liquid water, using a simple empirical forcefield model based on TIP4P-like point charges [1]. We will start from quickly checking the convergence of standard path integral molecular dynamics, and then use this example to test a number of advanced PI features. For the sake of speed of execution, we will use a very small (32 molecules) simulation box. However, if you have more time to carry out the exercise, you can modify the input to use the initial configurations in `data/water-216.pdb` . You should be able to complete at least the first three exercises in a couple of hours. \n",
    "Hints: Do not wait for the full simulations to be complete: as soon as you have collected enough statistics to understand what’s going on and to compare with previous runs, you should move on to the next exercise."

    "As a final example (in folder `ex-4/`) we will combine all the bits and pieces, performing a simulation of ice at 100K, combining two different techniques to speed up the calculation. We will use a fourth-order Suzuki-Chin factorization of the Boltzmann operator [7, 8], combined with a finite-difference integrator [9]. Ring-polymer contraction [10] can also be used, that speeds up simulations by evaluating long-range interactions on a reduced number of beads. We will not cover here the theory behind these techniques, so if you are not familiar with it, you are encouraged to read up the relevant literature before embarking in this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: These start to be serious simulations, and it will not be possible to converge them at any decent level with a few minutes on a laptop. You can let them run overnight and/or run them on a more powerful computer if you want to familiarize yourself with the convergence behavior of these accelerated PI methods.\n",

    "While the simulation runs, look at the input file. You’ll notice that we are outputting four more properties: `kinetic_opsc`, `kinetic_tdsc`, `potential_opsc`, `potential_tdsc` . These are the \"thermodynamic\" and \"operator\" versions of the Suzuki-Chin estimators for kinetic and potential energy. Note that – contrary to the Trotter case – the thermodynamic estimators are well-behaved when the number of beads is increased. You should see that after a few steps both the `Td` and the `Op` versions converge to very similar values, and that they are both significantly different from the conventional estimators (that do not correspond to any physical observable when sampling a fourth-order Hamiltonian, and are output only for didactic purposes). \n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: Remember, when you compute averages, that you’ll have to discard the (rather long) equilibration part, and that you should use the columns that correspond to the S-C estimators.\n",

If you are familiar with the structure of LAMMPS input files, you’ll notice that in.ice_long computes only Lennard-Jones and Coulomb terms, while bonded terms contain dummy values. Conversely, in.ice_short only computes the bonded (stretch and bend) interactions. These two LAMMPS instances connect to two separate ```<ffsocket>``` objects, that provide evaluators for the short and long-range components of the force. Now, within the description of the ```<system>```, you will find the setup of the physical interactions, as they will be used by the integrator:\n",

Conversely, the short-range component should be computed on the default (total) number of beads, as specified in the ```<initialize>``` section. Now compare the results with what you obtained with the `highorder.xml` input. You should observe only small differences, although considerably fewer long-range force evaluations have been used. \n",
    "    Hints: For a cheap potential as the one we consider here, communication overhead is dominant, and so the speed-up will not be very noticeable. Nevertheless, this strategy can be very advantageous when the long-range part of the interaction is time-consuming, such as in an ab initio simulation."
