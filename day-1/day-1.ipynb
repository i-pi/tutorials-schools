Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the dynamics of the electronic degrees of freedom is completely decoupled from that of the nuclei, and the electrons always occupy the ground state for each configuration of the nuclei. In a fully classical treatment of nuclei, the additional assumption is made that their dynamics can be described in terms of the Hamiltonian\n",

    "The time domain can then be discretized into small and finite time steps with length $\\Delta t$ . The key processes of a molecular dynamics run are illustrated in the flowchart below. At the initialization stage, the program is informed about some basic information about the system, such as the number of atoms, their types, system size, etc. After that, the program goes through the loop “Forces → Motion → Analysis” once per discrete simulation time step. The force acting on each atom\n",

A graphical representation of how i-PI works is given in the scheme below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will perform a simple Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculation. Instead of doing the simulation directly using an out-of-the-box MD software such as LAMMPS [1], we are going to complete the task in a slightly more complex way. We are going to use i-PI in conjunction with LAMMPS to demonstrate a client/server model for (path integral) molecular dynamics as well as the subtle advantages that it brings. The simulation will be performed on one gas phase water molecule using NVT ensemble at 300K. We will also record the kinetic and potential energy of the system.\n",
