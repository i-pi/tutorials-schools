    "<h2>Exercise 1 - Velocity and dipole real time correlation functions</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first exercise, we will calculate time correlation functions with path integral based methods, namely centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) [1], ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) [2], and thermostated ring polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD)[3]. All these methods have been explained in the lectures, and we encourage you to look at the respective references for in more details. We note that for the TIP4P-style of charges, the dipole moment is a linear function of the coordinates, and therefore the dipole estimator in CMD, RPMD, and TRPMD is always the same and can be calculated from the centroid positions (or velocities, in the case of its derivative). Due to time constraints we will only perform short (10 ps) simulations, and you’ll be provided extensive outputs for further analysis in the exercises that require it. Inputs for simulating different PI-based methods are also provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Vibrational spectra with classical nuclei (Time: 10 minutes)</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by calculating both dipole and velocity correlation functions with classical nuclei. In order to do this, we have provided pre-computed i-PI checkpoint files from a long thermalization run of Ice Ih at 200 K. Checkpoint files are a feature of i-PI that can be written through the keyword ```<checkpoint>``` in the ```<output>``` block of i-PI’s input file, for which a syntax example would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "   ```<checkpoint filename=\"restart\" stride=\"2000\" overwrite=\"false\"/>```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inserting this keyword in a thermalization run provides a series of files that can be used to restart simulations from different points of the thermalization simulation (defined by the option stride). You can find checkpoint files from an NVT run with classical nuclei in the `ex-1/checkpoint-nvt` directory.\n",
    "In order to run the NVE trajectory needed to compute the correlation functions, do:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ cd ex-1/nve` <br>\n",
    "`$ vi nve.xml`\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `nve.xml` is an example of input for NVE simulations. Take some time reading through it. For the current simulation, the most important quantity we will print out is the velocity of the atoms (here given by the centroid velocities since there is only one bead). You will notice that there are some fields marked with `xxx` in the input file. These should be substituted by a number of your choice, corresponding to the identity of the checkpoint file you want to choose. You can substitute `xxx` by a number by hand or use a command.\n",
    "For example, in order to create a new directory with all necessary input files, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ number=6` <br>\n",
    "`$ mkdir dir_${number}` <br>\n",
    "`$ sed \"s/xxx/${number}/g\" nve.xml > dir_${number}/input.xml` <br>\n",
    "`$ cd dir_${number}` <br>\n",
    "`$ cp ../../lammps_inputs/* .`\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now the directory `dir_${number}` contains all input files necessary to start our simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to launch one instance of i-PI and LAMMPS, run:\n",

    "`$ i-pi input.xml &> log.ipi &` <br>\n",

    "Look at outputs using gnuplot and vmd . In order to create the dipole and velocity autocorrelations, we provide scripts in the `day-3/tools` folder that uses trajworks functionalities in order to perform Fourier transforms and calculate autocorrelation functions, called `post-vel` and `post-dpl` . Note that we will actually calculate the dipole derivative autocorrelation function, which already includes an extra $\\omega^2$ factor in comparison to the dipole autocorrelation.\n",
